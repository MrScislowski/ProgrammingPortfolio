## Objective statement

For the past 12 years I have been a high school computer science / math teacher. The most rewarding part of my job has been analyzing performance data and streamlining workflows using the analytical skills and experience I developed during my time in college and graduate school for physics. I would like to transition to a career where I can apply and hone those skills in more depth.
