## Objective statement

For the past 12 years I have been a high school computer science / math teacher. I am a lifelong lover of learning, and have enjoyed the challenge of connecting high school math/science content to more advanced applications in physics, algorithms, and other familiar fields. The most rewarding part of my job has been analyzing performance data and streamlining workflows using the analytical skills and experience I developed during my time in college and graduate school. I would like to transition to a career where I can apply and hone those skills in more depth.

## Education

### MSc (physics) from University of Washington, 2008-2011

As a research assistant working on the SNO+ neutrino observation experiment, I worked on simulating neutrino and background radiation detection in liquid scintillator using the Geant4 particle physics software toolkit.

### BSc (physics) from University of Manchester, 2004-2008

Capstone projects consisted of:

- Writing C code (using Runge-Kutta method to solve Schrodinger equation) to generate theoretical scattering cross sections for one-pion exchange model, and compare to experimental data
- Writing shell scripts to analyze and visualize the performance of several distributed data storage methods for the Large Hadron Collider at CERN

## Experience

### High School Math Computer Science Teacher, Wichita area high schools, 2012-present

- Taught computer science, physics, and math classes including AP Computer Science A and AP Calculus
- Collected data and performed analysis on academic performance, attendance data, and remote learning engagement patterns
- Scraped and categorized content from a variety of sources (including College Board, Khan Academy) to streamline accessibility
- Developed a full stack web app for use by teachers and students to facilitate equitable access to classroom assistance

## Technical Projects

### HWData (SQL, R w/ tidyverse), 2019

Kept math class grades in SQLite database, and used R markdown files to:

- make a graphical summary of each student's performance over the semester to look for notable improvements / performance decreases
- determine the correlation between quiz scores, homework completion, and test scores
- determine the days of the week students are missing assignments most, and student responses to missing class (e.g. on cloud learning platform)

### APCalculusResourceOrganizer, 2019

Gathered data with manual screenshot of past AP tests, scraping Khan Academy exercises, and scraping AP classroom website. Using this:

- analyzed which topics were tested most in recent AP tests, and kept track of how much practice on each topic I had assigned
- generated large question bank html document that allowed quick and easy access to all the available content, and to track what I had used already
- generated individualized student study plans and class summary data using AP Practic exam performance data

### InfiniteCampus, 2020

School was implementing experimental policy of "flex days" where students could choose which classes to visit and scan their student ID barcode to log attendance. However, attendance data was hard to access through student information system (SIS). I used R to analyze all of the attendance data and:

- proposed changes to real-time scanning interface
- generated graphical display for each students flex day behavior that was more user friendly than provided by SIS

### Video Administration, 2021
